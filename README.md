# Five Hundred Scorer
Simple app facilitating the scoring of 500 card games without pen and paper.

Written using React Native, and Expo. The UI is primarily comprised of material design compliant components from the React Native Paper library.

I chose this project mainly to learn some new technologies. Typescript, React Hooks, React Native and Material Design were all new to me.
